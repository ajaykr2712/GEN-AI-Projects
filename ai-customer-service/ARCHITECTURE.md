# Architecture Documentation

## System Architecture Overview

The AI Customer Service Assistant follows a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** approach with **Clean Architecture** principles, implementing a **microservices-ready** monolithic structure that can be easily decomposed.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. **Domain Layer** (Core Business Logic)
- **Entities**: Core business objects (User, Conversation, Message)
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects (Email, MessageContent)
- **Domain Services**: Business logic that doesn't belong to entities
- **Repositories**: Abstract data access interfaces
- **Events**: Domain events for loose coupling

### 2. **Application Layer** (Use Cases)
- **Command Handlers**: Handle write operations
- **Query Handlers**: Handle read operations  
- **Event Handlers**: Process domain events
- **DTOs**: Data transfer objects for API communication

### 3. **Infrastructure Layer** (External Concerns)
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy implementations
- **External APIs**: OpenAI, email services
- **Caching**: Redis implementation
- **Message Queue**: Celery/RabbitMQ for async processing

### 4. **Presentation Layer** (API/UI)
- **REST API**: FastAPI endpoints
- **GraphQL**: For complex queries (optional)
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication
- **Frontend**: React SPA

## Design Patterns Implemented

### 1. **Repository Pattern**
- Abstract data access layer
- Enables easy testing and database switching
- Implemented for all aggregates

### 2. **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**
- Separate read and write models
- Optimized query performance
- Better scalability

### 3. **Event Sourcing** (Partial)
- Domain events for audit trails
- Asynchronous processing
- Better debugging and analytics

### 4. **Factory Pattern**
- Service factory for dependency injection
- Configuration-based service creation
- Better testability

### 5. **Observer Pattern**
- Event-driven architecture
- Loose coupling between components
- Real-time notifications

### 6. **Strategy Pattern**
- Multiple AI providers support
- Different authentication strategies
- Configurable business rules

## Microservices Architecture (Ready)

The system is designed to be easily decomposed into microservices:

### **Core Services:**
1. **User Service**: Authentication and user management
2. **Chat Service**: AI conversations and message handling
3. **Analytics Service**: Data processing and reporting
4. **Notification Service**: Email, SMS, push notifications
5. **AI Service**: OpenAI integration and model management

### **Supporting Services:**
1. **API Gateway**: Request routing and rate limiting
2. **Config Service**: Centralized configuration
3. **Discovery Service**: Service registration and discovery
4. **Monitoring Service**: Health checks and metrics

## Scalability Features

### **Horizontal Scaling:**
- Stateless application design
- Database connection pooling
- Read replicas for query optimization
- CDN integration for static assets

### **Caching Strategy:**
- Redis for session storage
- Application-level caching
- Database query caching
- API response caching

### **Performance Optimization:**
- Async/await throughout
- Database query optimization
- Lazy loading for relationships
- Background job processing

## Security Architecture

### **Authentication & Authorization:**
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- OAuth2 integration ready
- API key management

### **Data Protection:**
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- PII data anonymization
- GDPR compliance features
- Audit logging

## Monitoring & Observability

### **Logging:**
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Centralized log aggregation
- Different log levels per environment
- Security event logging

### **Metrics:**
- Business metrics (conversations, response times)
- Technical metrics (API latency, error rates)
- Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
- Custom dashboard creation

### **Tracing:**
- Distributed tracing across services
- Request flow visualization
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Error correlation

## Deployment Architecture

### **Container Strategy:**
- Multi-stage Docker builds
- Optimized image sizes
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Resource limits and requests

### **Orchestration:**
- Kubernetes manifests
- Auto-scaling policies
- Rolling deployments
- Blue-green deployment support

### **CI/CD Pipeline:**
- Automated testing at multiple levels
- Security scanning and compliance checks
- Automated deployment to staging/production
- Rollback capabilities

## Data Architecture

### **Database Design:**
- Normalized schema for transactional data
- Denormalized views for analytics
- Database migration strategy
- Backup and disaster recovery

### **Data Flow:**
- Event-driven data synchronization
- ETL pipelines for analytics
- Real-time data streaming
- Data validation and cleansing

## Integration Architecture

### **External APIs:**
- Circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- API versioning strategy
- Rate limiting and throttling

### **Message Queue:**
- Asynchronous task processing
- Event publishing and subscription
