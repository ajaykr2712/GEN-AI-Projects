# AI Customer Service Assistant - Enhanced Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The AI Customer Service Assistant is built using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** with **Clean Architecture** principles, implementing a **microservices-ready** monolithic structure that can be easily decomposed. The system features advanced monitoring, comprehensive testing, and production-ready scalability patterns.

## Architecture Layers
